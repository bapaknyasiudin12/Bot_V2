Hi, This is WhatsApp Bot v2, but it is outdated. For those of you who want to run this bot, here's how:
1. Make sure you have Node.js
2. Make sure you also install WhatsApp-Web.js. I recommend using Git as a terminal.
3. Change the storage location of your Google Chrome.exe. Make sure what you copy is the address that goes to google-chrome.exe.
4. Once the preparation is complete, you can run the bot using node.js. Make sure the words "CLIENT READY" appear which indicates the bot can be used.
5. Scan the QR code, and BOOM! Bots are running!!!

The way to stop the bot is simply to press the cross or log out of WhatsApp Web, then the bot will stop.

Don't forget to star this repository.
